# messaging-app
This is my first project using websockets. I recently participated in a hackathon where the theme was 'create a multiplayer app', and my team used websockets for our project. I was really keen to test out websockets further by creating a simple messaging app, and chose to work with [socket.io](https://socket.io/) for this project. 

:sparkles: This project is now deployed! [View it here](https://messaging-app-websockets.up.railway.app/).
